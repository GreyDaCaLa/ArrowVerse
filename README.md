# Arrow verse Project



## Directions for running site locally

1. open intended directory in a command line window
2. enter: git clone https://github.com/GreyDaCaLa/ArrowVerse
	wait for download to finish
3. navigate command line window to new ArrowVerse Directory

4. Install npm dependencies and packages with npm install

5. run site with npm start


## additional thoughts

This was a fun project due to me being a fan of the arrowverse. I can see my self furthering this project to the rest of the TV MAze API. I left the root URL blank just incase i do need to add more search options for other shows. For now i focused only on the arrow verse but wrote my code to work for almost any site.
